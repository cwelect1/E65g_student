 which  implements the EngineProtocol method, implementing the Game Of Life rules as in Assignment 3.  
 
 Create a singleton of StandardEngine in a lazy manner.  
    That creates a grid of size 10x10 by default.  
 Whenever the grid is created or changed, notify the delegate with the delegate method 
 and publish the grid object using an NSNotification.
